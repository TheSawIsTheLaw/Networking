Superfluous since the first day
Hear the carol of the needle cannot wait
Leech an odyssey of ashtrays
Put a saddle on your back I need a break

One percent to black
And then you back into the set
Hear a snapping the second it conjugated
Lean the fuck in to your high space
Faded? okay
Armed up bandit pull your sleeves and trek in missions
Need a band to make a renegade of vessels set to mitigate
See the preacher needs some ayahuasca
Knocking at your bible Book of psalms, a gaol
Break open a batch up for your recital
Wear a tie
Choke and blackout till your 20/20

Superfluous since the first day
Hear the carol of the needle cannot wait
Leech an odyssey of ashtrays
Put a saddle on your back I need a break
Superfluous since the first day
Hear the carol of the needle cannot wait
Leech an odyssey of ashtrays
Put a saddle on your back I need a break

Doubted sin
Disease
Admission; Snort Cocaine for Jesus
Zip
Contagious
Stay affected like an Alcoholics fetus
At the Everglades and knees deep
Rattle brain into a seizure
What you want?
Take your bitching
Get baptized till you're never seen again

Superfluous since the first day
Hear the carol of the needle cannot wait
Leech an odyssey of ashtrays
Put a saddle on your back I need a break
Superfluous since the first day
Hear the carol of the needle cannot wait
Leech an odyssey of ashtrays
Put a saddle on your back I need a break
