All that's left, nothing to fear, I disappear
Running outta rubber on my wheels, I was outta gear
Cycle around, no elevate, never take the stairs
Staring at the vacant silhouette like it was ever there
In a vat, suspended tap
Dripping out the nose, hemoglobin, I froze
Stuck in a vantablack hole
I'm outta cold [?]
I walk on fire brands, hundred degrees
I've been so lavish on average don't need a cosign
Napping on temperatures sleeping outta money no time
Out in my silence, I'm out of words and that ain't no lie
Know that [?] post I withdraw sidе
Caught a smile with no face no
Back with the [?] likе it's based
Put your fucking gear on me when I'm faceless
Summon every known demon up to my daycare (uh)

Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, ah
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump off the fucking bridge, want a [?]
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, ah
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump off the fucking bridge, want a [?]

Cut the mask with the face off
Dressed up in black, on the back with the laces
I never had a doubt, might blank, let it vacate
I'm in the moment, I'm in a vat in the morning down in the basement
Too fast never taste that chase on my breath
Go redact, run opaque, it's like nobody wanna leave
But you're stuck into stasis
Cut in the lead like [?] and wake up from the daydream

Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, ah
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump off the fucking bridge, want a [?]
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, ah
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump off the fucking bridge, want a [?]

I'm floating ooooh
Fall away, heavily, I'm still awake
No way I could feel unsafe, praise the sun and receive a ray
I could see no place I could lay
Take the weight
All that I hate is [?]
Take the weight
Holding my breath is [?]
